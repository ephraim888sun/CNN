    "[1.5 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",

Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Convince me that your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. \n"

Investigate at least two different convolutional network architectures and investigate changing one or more parameters of each architecture such as the number of filters. This means, at a  minimum, you will train a total of four models (2 different architectures, with 2 parameters changed in each architecture). Use the method of train/test splitting and evaluation metric that you argued for at the beginning of the lab. Visualize the performance of the training and validation sets per iteration (use the \"history\" parameter of Keras). Be sure that models converge. \n",
